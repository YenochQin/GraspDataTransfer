# Grasp Data Transfer

A simple data collection tool for grasp2018.

Coding in python3.8. Numpy and Pandas are needed.

Although GRASP has some original tools to handle the data, the programs written in fortran are less convenient to operate and the operations are fixed, which is not conducive to subsequent processing.
